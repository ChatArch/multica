 * Resolve a raw `/{ws}/issues/{segment}` route parameter — a UUID or a

 *
 * Why callers must key on the UUID rather than the raw segment: the realtime
 * updaters patch `issueKeys.detail(wsId, issue.id)` with the UUID carried by
 * the websocket payload (`ws-updaters.ts`). A view keyed on the identifier
 * would sit on a cache entry no realtime event can ever reach, so the detail
 * page would render fine and then silently stop updating. The identifier stays
 * a presentation concern: it lives in the URL, never in a cache key.
 *
 * Resolution reuses `GET /api/issues/{id}`, which accepts either form, so it is
 * the same request the detail view would have made anyway. Handing that
 * response to the canonical query as `initialData` is what holds it to ONE
 * request: `initialData` is applied while the observer is created, so the
 * canonical query never observes an empty cache and never fires a fetch of its
 * own. Seeding the cache from an effect instead would run after that decision
 * and leave the single-request property resting on hook ordering.
